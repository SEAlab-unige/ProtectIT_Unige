# Processed Session Files

These are the `.idx3` and `.idx1` files used during the experiments in the paper.  
Each subfolder corresponds to a specific dataset.

Strategies refer to the preprocessing variants discussed in the paper,  
based on header handling (e.g., IP/MAC anonymization, port zeroing, UDP padding).

You can use these files directly for model training and evaluation.
